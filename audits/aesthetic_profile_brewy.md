## Competitive Landscape Snapshot

### Visual Positioning vs. Competitors

| Brand | Color Temperature | Composition | Aesthetic (1-10) | Visual Differentiator |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Brewy** (Target) | Warm/Earthy | Minimalist/Clean | 9/10 | **"The Scientific Naturalist"** - Clean lines meets raw nature. |
| **Four Sigmatic** | Vibrant/Red | Illustrated/Busy | 8/10 | **"The Fun Fungi"** - Playful, supermarket-friendly. |
| **Mud/Wtr** | Cool/Brown/Grey | Gritty/Industrial | 8/10 | **"The Rebellion"** - Anti-coffee, raw, masculine. |
| **Ryze** | Warm/Beige | Soft/Lifestyle | 7/10 | **"The Daily Ritual"** - Approachable, influencer-style. |

### The Visual Gap
> **What's standard**: Either "Hippie/Crunchy" (brown bags, bad fonts) OR "Hyper-Performance" (black/red, aggressive).
> **What's missing**: **"Sophisticated Science"**. A brand that looks like skin-care (clean, premium) but feels like a nature documentary.
> **Our play**: Position Brewy as the **"Aesop of Mushroom Coffee"**. Premium, aromatic, design-led, but scientifically grounded.
