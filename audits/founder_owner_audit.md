# Founder / Owner Audit: Brewy

> **Founder**: [NOT IDENTIFIED IN BRIEF]
> **Status**: Faceless Brand (Currently)

---

## 1. Identification
*   **Name**: Unknown.
*   **Role**: Unknown.
*   **Public Profile**: N/A.

## 2. Brand Alignment Risk
*   **Verdict**: **Neutral / Blank**.
*   **Risk**: A "Faceless" health brand can struggle with trust. People want to know *who* is sourcing the mushrooms. Is it a passionate bio-hacker? Or a faceless dropshipper?

## 3. The "Founder-Led" Opportunity (Recommendation)
In the current "Founder Mode" era of marketing, people buy from people.
*   **Option A: The Expert**. If the founder has health/science credentials, lean in. "Formatted by Dr. X."
*   **Option B: The Explorer**. "I traveled to Finland to find the best mushrooms."
*   **Option C: The Patient Zero**. "I was burnt out, so I built this." (Most common, highly relatable).

## 4. Recommendation
*   **Reveal the Founder**. Even if not "famous", having a human face builds trust in the "purity" of the product.
*   **Action**: Add a "Meet the Founder" section to the About page and Welcome Email series. Stories sell supplements.
