# Cross-Audit Mismatch Analysis: Brewy

> **Comparator**: Planned Vibe (Phase 1) vs. Current Reality (Digital Audit)

---

## 1. Expectation vs. Reality

| Dimension | The "Vibe" (Goal) | The Reality (Current) | Match Verdict |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| **Visuals** | Earthy, Minimalist, Premium. | Non-Existent. | **N/A** |
| **Voice** | Educated, Friendly, Grounded. | Silent. | **N/A** |
| **Trust** | "Clinical Grade" / Verified. | Unknown / Unverified. | **Gap** |

## 2. Identified Mismatches
*   **The "Trust Gap"**: We want to be "Scientific & Premium", but a brand with zero history looks risky.
    *   *Fix*: **Over-index on Social Proof immediately**. Use "Beta Tester" reviews or quotes on the landing page even before full launch.

## 3. Alignment Plan
Since we are building from scratch, there is no "Mismatch" to fix, only **Alignment to Create**.
*   **Rule 1**: The Instagram Grid must match the Packaging colors exactly.
*   **Rule 2**: The Website copy must match the "Educated" tone—no slang, no hype, just clarity.
