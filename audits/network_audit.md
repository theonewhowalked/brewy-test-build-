## 1. Internal Network Map (The "Face" of the Brand)

| Name | Role | Public Profile (URL) | Brand Alignment | Notes |
|------|------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Founder (TBD)** | Founder / CEO | N/A | **Unknown** | *Critical Gap*: Founder needs to be the "Chief Science Officer" of the brand. |
| **Head of Coffee** | Product Lead | N/A | **High (Target)** | Needs to be a visible artisan, not just a backend operator. |
| **Community Lead** | Social | N/A | **High (Target)** | Must embody the "Flow State" lifestyle. |

### Alignment Gap Analysis
> Are the people representing the brand actually living the brand values?
- **Finding**: Currently, the brand is faceless. In the "Scientific Naturalist" archetype, authority comes from *people* (scientists, roasters), not just logos.
- **Risk**: High. "Faceless" functional mushroom brands look like dropshipping scams.
- **Recommendation**: Founder must start "Building in Public" on LinkedIn immediately to establish human trust.

2.  **Notion / Figma**: The tools of our target audience.
