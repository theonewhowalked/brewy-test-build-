# Brewy: The Code of Conduct
> *confidential // for internal eyes only*

---

## 0. The North Star (Why We Are Here)
> **"Nature, Quantified."**

**Our Manifesto**:
We believe that "energy" shouldn't come with a debt. Traditional coffee borrows energy from tomorrow to pay for today (the jitters, the crash). That's a bug in the code.
Brewy isn't "alternative coffee" for people who hate coffee. It's **evolved coffee** for people who love their brain. We merge the ritual of a barista pour-over with the clinical precision of functional mycology. No magic. No woo-woo. Just biology, beautifully brewed.

# The Brewy Brand Book

## 1. Brand Essence
> **"Barista Grade. Lab Tested."**

* **Vision**: To make "Functional Energy" the default standard for the modern professional.
* **Values**:
    1. **Radical Transparency**: We show the lab reports. We list the mg of beta-glucans. If we can't prove it, we don't sell it.
    2. **Taste is King**: If it tastes like dirt, it's failed. We are coffee roasters first, mycologists second.
    3. **Design for Calm**: Every touchpoint (packaging, website, copy) should lower the user's cortisol, not spike it.

### Brand Psychology
* **Primary Archetype**: **The Sage** (The Scientist/Teacher).
    * *Why*: Our customer seeks *clarity* and *truth* in a noisy supplement market.
* **Secondary Archetype**: **The Creator** (The Artisan).
    * *Why*: We respect the craft of coffee. We value aesthetics and sensory detail.
* **Emotional Narrative**:
    > You love the *idea* of coffee (the smell, the warmth, the start), but you hate the *reality* of coffee (the anxiety, the crash). Brewy restores the romance by fixing the physiology.

### Brand Promise & Impact
*   **The Moonshot**: To end the "Caffeine Crash" epidemic in the creative class.
*   **The Legacy**: To be the brand that forced the supplement industry to be transparent about ingredients.
*   **The Feeling**: **Grounded Levity**. That feeling of being fully awake, but completely calm.
*   **Trigger Moment**: 2:00 PM. The slump. The moment you reach for a second cup but dread the anxiety.

## 2. Brand Architecture & Governance
### Typology
**Type**: **Branded House**
Everything we release (Coffee, Matcha, Creamer) lives under the master "Brewy" aesthetic. We build equity in one name.

### Strategic Governance
* **Model**: **Centralized**. All creative assets must pass through the Core Brand Studio. Consistency builds trust.
* **Drift Detection**: Any asset using "Comic Sans", "Neon Colors", or "Hype Bro Language" is a violation.

---

## 3. Visual Identity

### Logo & Usage
*   **Primary Logo**: The "Spore Serif". A custom serif wordmark where the 'B' implies a mushroom cap.
*   **Clearance Zone**: 50% of the logo height on all sides.
*   **Common Misuse**:
    *   ❌ Do not make it "Trippy" or "Psychedelic". We are science, not hallucinations.
    *   ❌ Do not use bright red (looks like danger/poison).

### Token Taxonomy (Design System)
| Token Name | Role | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `color-primary` | Earth / Brand | `#4A3B32` (Warm Mocha) |
| `color-secondary` | Nature / Accent | `#2E4A3D` (Canopy Green) |
| `color-action` | Conversion | `#D4A373` (Fungi Gold) |
| `color-surface` | Background | `#F5F1E6` (Oat Cream) |

### Typography
* **Primary Font**: `Playfair Display` (Headings). Editorial, confident, classic.
* **Secondary Font**: `Inter` (Body/UI). Clean, legible, scientific.

### Motion & Sensory Identity
* **Motion Behaviors**: **Slow Growth**. Animations should ease in like a plant unfurling. No jarring cuts.
* **Sonic Branding**: The sound of a ceramic cup placing on a wooden coaster. Deep, textural, solid.

## 4. Voice & Tone

### Core Voice
* **Tone Keywords**: **Educated, Grounded, Friendly.**

### Contextual Tone Matrix
| Context | Tone Adjustment | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marketing** | **The Curator** | *"We sourced these beans from the Huila region for their caramel notes."* |
| **Science** | **The Professor** | *"Lion's Mane stimulates NGF production. Here's the chart."* |
| **Social** | **The Smart Friend** | *"Stop borrowing energy from tomorrow. Reset your baseline."* |

### Brand Governance (The Anti-Lexicon)
| Banned Word | Why It's Banned | Use Instead |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Magic" | We are science, not fantasy. | "Functional" / "Adaptogenic" |
| "Trip / High" | We are legal and safe. | "Flow / Focus" |
| "Superfood" | Meaningless buzzword. | "Nutrient Dense" |
| "Java / Joe" | Generic and dated. | "Brew / Coffee" |

## 5. Competitive Differentiation

### How We're Different

| Dimension | Competitors (Mud/Wtr, Ryze) | Brewy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Visual Feel** | Gritty/Industrial or "Generic Influencer" | **Premium Apothecary / Editorial** |
| **Voice** | Rebellious ("F*ck Coffee") | **Respectful ("Upgrade Coffee")** |
| **Trust** | "Trust the Vibe" | **"Trust the Data" (QR Code Verification)** |
| **Product** | Muddy powders | **Barista-Grade Beans** |

### The One-Line Differentiator
> **"The only mushroom coffee for people who actually like the taste of coffee."**

---

## 6. Brand Application
* **Social Media**:
    *   **The Grid**: Needs to look like a magazine layout. Text on cream backgrounds + Macro photography.
    *   **Stories**: Behind the scenes at the roastery/lab. Raw, handheld, authentic.
*   **Web**:
    *   Clean white space. Large typography. "Shopify Plus" feel even on day one.

### Hashtags
*   #Brewy #FunctionalCoffee #FlowState
*   #MorningRitual #CoffeeScience #NoCrash

## 7. The Digital Artisans (AI Protocols)

### Asset Generation Prompts

#### Photography (Midjourney)
> **Subject:** A ceramic mug of black coffee sitting on a piece of raw slate, surrounded by moss and forest floor textures. Use soft morning light.
> **Style:** Editorial food photography, Kinfolk magazine style, minimalist, earthy, high texture.
> **--ar**: 4:5
> **--no**: steam clouds, cartoon, illustration, plastic, bright colors, text.

#### Copywriting Assistant (System Prompt)
> "You are the Head of Coffee at Brewy. You are obsessive about quality and science, but you speak with warmth. You love explaining *why* things work.
> **Style**: Educated but accessible. Like a cool professor.
> **Constraint**: Never use 'magic' or 'superfood'. Focus on 'clarity' and 'ritual'."
