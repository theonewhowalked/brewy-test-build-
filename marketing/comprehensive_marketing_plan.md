# Comprehensive Marketing Plan: Brewy

## Executive Summary
Brewy enters a crowded market (Mushroom Coffee) by pivoting away from the "Wellness Vibe" war and opening a new front: **"Scientific Luxury"**. While competitors fight over who is more "natural", we will win by proving we are more **potent** and **delicious**. Our strategy is "The Aesop of Coffee" — premium design, absolute transparency, and education-first content.
