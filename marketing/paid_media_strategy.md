*   **Ad Copy**:
    *   *H1*: "Better Than Mud."

## 4. TikTok Strategy

### "Spark Ads" Protocol
Do not run "Ads". Run "Content".
1.  **Seed the Product**: Send Brewy to 20 "Cozy Desk" creators.
2.  **Wait for Organic Hits**: If a creator's video gets >1k views organically, ask for the "Spark Code".
3.  **Put Money Behind It**: Boost THAT video from THEIR handle.
    *   *Why*: It looks authentic. It leverages their trust.
    *   *Budget*: $50/day per winning video.

## 5. Creative Testing Roadmap

| Week | Test Focus | Hypothesis |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Week 1** | **Static vs. Video** | Does high-aesthetic photography beat ugc-style video? |
| **Week 2** | **"Taste" vs. "Focus"** | Do people buy for the flavor or the effect? |
| **Week 3** | **Long vs. Short Copy** | Does a "Mini-Blog" caption build more trust than a one-liner? |
| **Week 4** | **Landing Page** | "Home Page" vs. "Offer Page" (Bundle). |
