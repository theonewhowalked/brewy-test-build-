2.  **Calm (L-Theanine)**: Balanced with adaptogens to smooth out the caffeine spike. No crash. No anxiety.

## About Page

### The Story
**Headline**: We believe you shouldn't have to choose between productivity and peace.
**Hook**: I was drinking 4 cups a day. I was successful, but I was a wreck. Wired, tired, and anxious.
**The Discovery**: I tried the "mud water" alternatives. They tasted like dirt. I tried nootropics. They felt like chemicals.
**The Solution**: I realized the problem wasn't coffee. It was the *delivery system*. We spent 2 years engineering a process to infuse high-quality Arabica beans with adaptogenic mushrooms.
**The Mission**: To make "Functional Energy" the default standard for the creative class.

### Core Values
1.  **Radical Transparency**: We publish our lab reports.
2.  **Taste is King**: If it's not delicious, it's a failure.
3.  **Design for Calm**: We exist to lower your cortisol, not spike it.
