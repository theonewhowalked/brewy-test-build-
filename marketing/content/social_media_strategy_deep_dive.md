> **Goal**: Dominate the "Scientific Wellness" niche on Instagram and LinkedIn.

---

## 1. Instagram Strategy (`@drinkbrewy`)

### Profile Optimization
- **Handle**: `@drinkbrewy` (Consistent across all channels)
- **Name**: Brewy | Focus & Mushroom Coffee
- **Bio**:
    > The bug in your morning routine: Fixed. 🍄
    > 100% Fruiting Bodies. Zero Jitters.
    > The only coffee with a public lab report. 👇
    > [LinkInBio: Shop Beta Batch]
- **Highlights**:
    - 🔬 **Science** (Lab reports, diagrams of adenosine)
    - ☕ **Taste** (Pour overs, crema shots, "Not Mud")
    - 🗣️ **Reviews** (User testimonials)
    - 🧠 **Focus** (Flow state tips)

### Content Pillars (The Grid)
1.  **The Aesthetic (40%)**: High-contrast, moody, warm earth tones. "Desk Setup" porn.
2.  **The Education (30%)**: Carousel slides explaining beta-glucans, cortisol, and adenosine.
3.  **The Social Proof (20%)**: Retweets, user photos, influencer unboxings.
4.  **The Product (10%)**: Direct beauty shots of the bag/beans.

### Engagement Protocol (The "Growth Engine")
- **The "High-Performance" Search**: Daily search for hashtags like `#codingsetup`, `#architecturedesign`, `#writerlife`. Comment meaningfully on their setup (not the coffee).
- **The Story Reply**: Reply to stories of target creators (designers, founders) to start DM convos.
- **Hashtag Clusters**:
    - **Niche**: `#functionalmushrooms`, `#nootropics`, `#lionmane`
    - **Tribe**: `#uxdesign`, `#frontenddev`, `#creativeprocess`
    - **Vibe**: `#darkacademia`, `#minimalistsetup`, `#coffeeritual`

## 2. LinkedIn Strategy (`Company Page + Founder`)

### Profile Optimization (Company)
- **Tagline**: "The first coffee engineered for Flow State."
- **About**: We didn't just roast beans; we fixed the caffeine crash. Brewy is the daily driver for the world's most focused creatives.

### Strategy: "Building in Public" (Founder-Led)
**The Founder must post 3x/week:**
1.  **The "Why"**: Sharing the journey of sourcing clean mushrooms vs. the "dust" competitors use.
2.  **The "Industry Roast"**: Calling out "Proprietary Blends" and lack of transparency.
3.  **The "Performance"**: Tips on deep work, preventing burnout, and managing energy (not time).

### Key Angle: "Productivity, Not Hustle"
LinkedIn is full of "Hustle Culture". **Brewy stands for "Calm Execution".**
- *Don't say*: "Crush your goals."
- *Do say*: "Protect your focus."

## 3. TikTok Strategy (Search First)

**Goal**: Rank for "ADHD Coffee" and "Brain Fog Cure".

### Videos Types
1.  **"Stop Drinking Mud"**: Visually comparing the sludge of MudWtr/Ryze vs. the clean pour of Brewy.
2.  **" The 2pm Crash Explained"**: Green screen video affecting a chart of Adenosine build-up.
3.  **"My Stack"**: Showing the morning stack of a coder (Keyboard, Monitor, Brewy).

## 4. Influencer Seeding ("The Beta Batch")

**Target**: The "Desk Setup" Community.
- **Offer**: "We love your setup. We want to complete it not with another gadget, but with the fuel. Sending you a bag of Brewy."
- **Ask**: No obligation. If you like it, just feature it in a morning story.
