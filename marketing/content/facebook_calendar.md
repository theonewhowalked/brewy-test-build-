## Week 1: The Problem (Caffeine Anxiety)

### Monday — Education
**Post 1: Native Video (30s)** — Adapted from IG Reel
- **Pillar**: Education
- **Hook**: "Your 2pm crash isn't a you problem."
- **Copy**:

Ever notice how you're full of energy at 9am, then completely dead by 2pm? ☕

It's not you. It's your coffee.

Here's the science: caffeine doesn't give you energy. It blocks adenosine (your sleep signal). When it wears off, ALL of that built-up adenosine hits you at once.

That's the crash. That's the jitters. That's borrowing from tomorrow.

We built Brewy to fix this. Lion's Mane + L-Theanine = calm focus without the debt.

Have you noticed this pattern in your own day? Tell me below 👇

- **Video**: Same as IG Reel but with text captions baked in (85% watch muted on FB).
- **CTA**: "Have you noticed this pattern?" (Conversation starter, not link push)
- **No hashtags** (Facebook penalizes hashtag-heavy posts)
- **AI Caption Prompt (Gemini)**: `Gemini: Adapt this Instagram caption for Facebook. Make it warmer, more conversational, remove hashtags, and end with an open question that invites comments. Voice: friendly science teacher, not brand account.`

### Wednesday — Social Proof
**Post 1: Image + Story**
- **Pillar**: Social Proof
- **Hook**: "We asked a coffee snob to try mushroom coffee."
- **Copy**:

We gave our friend Sarah (a barista for 8 years) a cup of Brewy without telling her what was in it.

Her reaction: "Wait, this is mushroom coffee? It tastes like a really good Colombian roast."

That's the whole point. We're roasters first. The Lion's Mane is invisible.

If you've ever tried mushroom coffee and hated it... we get it. Most of it tastes like dirt.

Would you give it another shot if the taste was actually good? 🤔

- **Image**: Photo-style shot of someone drinking from a Brewy cup, warm lighting.
- **AI Image Prompt (Midjourney)**: `Midjourney: /imagine prompt: candid photo of a woman in her 30s drinking coffee from a ceramic cup at a wooden desk, surprised pleased expression, warm natural light from window, shallow depth of field, earth tones --ar 16:9 --stylize 200`

### Friday — Community
**Post 1: Text + Poll**
- **Pillar**: Engagement
- **Hook**: "Quick question for the coffee drinkers..."
- **Copy**:

Quick question for the coffee drinkers in here ☕

How many cups are you drinking per day?

Don't lie 😂

Be honest — we're building something for the "I need 4 cups to function" crowd. And no, it's not more caffeine.

- **Poll Options**: 1 cup / 2-3 cups / 4+ cups / "I've lost count"
- **Strategy**: Use poll results in a follow-up post. "73% of you said 3+. Here's why that's a problem."

## Week 2: The Solution (What is Brewy?)

### Monday — Education
**Post 1: Photo Album (5 images)** — Adapted from IG Carousel
- **Hook**: "What's actually inside a cup of Brewy"
- **Copy**:

We don't do "proprietary blends." Here's exactly what's in every cup:

🫘 Single-origin Colombian Arabica (1,800m altitude)
🍄 Lion's Mane — 500mg fruiting bodies (not mycelium dust)
🍵 L-Theanine — 200mg (the amino acid that makes green tea calming)

Every bag has a QR code linking to the Certificate of Analysis.

We think if a brand won't show you what's inside, they're hiding something.

- **Images**: 5 individual slides from the IG carousel, reformatted for landscape.

### Wednesday — Authority
**Post 1: Video (30s)** — Adapted from IG Reel
- **Hook**: "Does it taste like mushrooms?"
- **Copy**: Same script as IG but with a softer intro: "We get this question literally every day, so let's settle it once and for all..."
- **CTA**: "Tag someone who needs to see this."

### Friday — Lifestyle
**Post 1: Share Prompt**
- **Hook**: "Show us your morning setup ☕"
- **Copy**:

We love seeing where Brewy ends up.
