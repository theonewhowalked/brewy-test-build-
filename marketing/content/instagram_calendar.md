## Week 1: The Problem (Caffeine Anxiety)

### Monday — Education
**Post 1: Reel (30s)**
- **Pillar**: Education
- **Hook**: "Stop borrowing energy from tomorrow."
- **Timed Script**:

| Time | Visual | Spoken Words |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 00-03 | Close-up of a wilting plant | "Your 2pm crash isn't a you problem." |
| 03-08 | Animated diagram of adenosine receptors | "Coffee blocks adenosine. It doesn't REMOVE it." |
| 08-18 | Time-lapse of the plant perking up | "So when the caffeine wears off, ALL that built-up adenosine hits you at once. That's the crash." |
| 18-25 | Slow-mo pour of Brewy into a ceramic cup | "Lion's Mane modulates the receptor. No block. No crash. Just... flow." |
| 25-30 | Pack shot with CTA | "Link in bio. Try the Beta Batch." |

- **Caption**: Stop borrowing energy from tomorrow. ☕

Coffee doesn't give you energy. It blocks adenosine (your sleep chemical) temporarily.

When the block wears off? ALL of it hits you at once.

That's the 2pm crash. That's the jitters. That's borrowing from tomorrow.

Brewy doesn't block. It modulates. Lion's Mane + L-Theanine + Arabica = Calm Focus.

No crash. No jitters. Just flow state. 🧠

👉 Link in bio to try the Beta Batch.

- **AI Video Prompt (VEO)**: `VEO: Generate a 30-second cinematic video. Scene 1: macro time-lapse of a monstera leaf wilting then rising, warm morning light. Scene 2: animated neural pathway with glowing receptors. Scene 3: slow-motion coffee pour into ceramic cup, shallow depth of field, earth tones #4A3B32. No text overlays.`
- **AI Caption Prompt (Gemini)**: `Gemini: Write an Instagram caption about the adenosine crash cycle. Voice: Scientific Naturalist (educated, not preachy). Structure: hook (bold claim), 3 short value paragraphs with line breaks, CTA to link in bio. Include 10 hashtags. Max 200 words.`

| 00-03 | Person sniffing a mushroom, disgusted face | "Does it taste like mushrooms?" |
| 03-06 | Dramatic pause. Camera zoom. | "God, no." |

| 20-25 | Pack shot, steam rising | "Taste the difference. Link in bio." |

- **Caption**: "Does it taste like mushrooms?" 🍄

We get this question every. single. day.

The answer: No. It tastes like premium single-origin coffee. Because it IS premium single-origin coffee.

The mushrooms (Lion's Mane, 500mg fruiting bodies) are infused during roasting. You get the focus. You skip the dirt flavor.

We're roasters first. Scientists second. ☕🔬

- **AI Video Prompt (VEO)**: `VEO: Generate a 25-second video. Scene 1: close-up of person sniffing a dried mushroom, disgusted expression, soft lighting. Scene 2: cinematic pour-over bloom in slow motion, golden light, shallow DOF. Scene 3: split screen comparison of muddy brown liquid vs clean black coffee. Color grade: warm earth tones #4A3B32.`
