## Welcome Sequence (The Brewing Protocol)

### Email 1: The Welcome (Don't Burn It)
**Subject Line**:
1. "Welcome to the ritual."
2. "Open this before you brew."
3. "The coffee upgrade you ordered."
**Preview Text**: Read this to avoid ruining the adaptogens.
**Timing**: Immediately after signup.

**Body**:
**Hook**: Most people drink coffee wrong. They blast their system with caffeine, spike their cortisol, and crash by 2pm.
**Brand Intro**: Welcome to Brewy. We fixed the bug in your morning routine.
**Value Promise**: You are now part of the "Functional Energy" movement. No jitters. No crash. Just flow.
**Protocol**:
1.  **Don't use boiling water.** (It burns the Lion's Mane). Wait 30 seconds off the boil.
2.  **Use the whisk.** (Mushroom extracts settle).
3.  **Drink it black.** (Or with oat milk. Just no sugar syrups).
**First CTA**: [Download the Brewing Guide PDF]
**P.S.**: Your Beta Batch is being packed as we speak.

### Email 2: The Introduction (Why We Exist)
**Subject Line**:
1. "Why I fired my coffee."
2. "The truth about 'Energy'."
3. "It wasn't the caffeine. It was the delivery."
**Preview Text**: The origin story of Brewy.
**Timing**: 24 hours later.

**Body**:
**Opening**: I used to drink 4 cups a day. I was wired, anxious, and tired.
**The Pivot**: I realized that traditional coffee borrows energy from tomorrow to pay for today. I wanted a way to pay cash.
**The Solution**: I didn't want "mud water" that tastes like dirt. I wanted *coffee*. So I spent 2 years finding a way to infuse Arabica beans with Lion's Mane without ruining the roast profile.
**Social Proof**: Now, 1,000+ designers and developers use Brewy to enter flow state.

### Email 3: The Science (Transparency)
**Subject Line**:
1. "See the lab report."
2. "Zero heavy metals. Verified."
3. "What 500mg looks like."
**Preview Text**: We believe in radical transparency.
**Timing**: 3 days later.

**Body**:
**Opening**: The supplement industry is unregulated. Most "Mushroom Coffees" are just mycelium (the root system) ground up with oats.
**The Demonstration**: We use 100% Fruiting Bodies. That's where the beta-glucans are.
**Key Takeaway**: If a brand won't show you their COA (Certificate of Analysis), run.
**Application**: Scan the QR code on your bag to see the exact potency of your batch.
**CTA**: [View our Lab Results]
